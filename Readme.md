# Fifteen Game
This project aims to recreate the Fifteen Game, which is a very popular game and known by many people. To create the game and screen layout, the C++ language and the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) framework will be used.

## Goals
Sort the pieces in descending order, from left to right and top to bottom, leaving the empty space in the last position (bottom right corner).

## Rules
The numbered pieces can be moved to the hole by moving the selected adjacent piece, to do this simply click on the piece you want to move. Each piece is selected in turn. The permitted movements are to move the pieces to the empty space. Do this until the board has the desired configuration.

## Game forms
The player has the option to choose the form of the game he wants to play. One of them is by ordering the numbers in decreasing order starting from the initial status of the game, with the numbers ordered in increasing order. Another way would be to shuffle the initial board, for this just click on the 'Shuffle' button and it will randomly shuffle the pieces.
